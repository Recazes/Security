basically fucking google and test on a VM
 
  kernel blah blah vulnerability
      Exploit-DB and CVEâ€™s are just a few places that one can use when researching vulnerabilities and exploits. Additional areas to research include:

  Vulnerability-labs
  
  Security firms such as Symantec Threat db and Rapid7 Threat db
  
  Security blogs
  
  Git Repositories
  
  Vendor sites such as Cisco Talos Group and Microsoft Security Intelligence
  
  Organizational tools (nation state actors might have already developed zero-days or developed tools)
  
  After pairing and exploit to a vulnerability attackers will tailor those exploits with additional code in order to provide additional capabilities. Some of these include:
  
  Remote access (call backs, bind sockets, etc)
  
  Automation (priv esc, self propagation)
  
  Encrypt communication flows
  
  Additional binaries for additional functionality
  
  such as tools that would not be native on system like socat or namp
  
  Encrypt hard drives (Ransomware)
  
  Even though pairing is completed and code is tailored what would happen next?
  
  Accruing the type of systems and softwares that you are attempting to exploit.
  
  Code testing against vulnerabilities in an sandbox environment to ensure functionality and identify any issues that could occur.
  
  Develop tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) on the usage of the current exploit (we could now call it a tool).
